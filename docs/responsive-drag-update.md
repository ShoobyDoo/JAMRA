# Responsive Drag Update - Real-time Visual Feedback

## Problem
Drag interaction felt delayed and unresponsive. The image only moved after releasing the mouse (threshold-based navigation), not during the drag itself.

## Solution
Added real-time visual feedback using CSS transforms that track mouse movement instantly.

## Implementation

### Vertical Mode
- **Already responsive**: Uses `useDragScroll` hook with native scroll behavior
- Scroll position updates in real-time as you drag
- No changes needed

### Paged Mode & Dual-Page Mode
Added instant visual feedback using transform animations:

#### Before (Delayed):
```typescript
// Only calculated delta on mouseup
const handleMouseUp = () => {
  const dragDelta = startY.current - e.clientY;
  if (Math.abs(dragDelta) > THRESHOLD) {
    // Navigate to next/prev page
  }
}
```

#### After (Responsive):
```typescript
// Real-time drag offset state
const [dragOffset, setDragOffset] = useState(0);

// Update offset instantly as you drag
const handleMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
  const delta = startY.current - e.clientY;
  setDragOffset(-delta); // Negative = drag down moves image down
}

// Image container with transform
<div style={{
  transform: `translateY(${dragOffset}px)`,
  transition: dragOffset === 0 ? 'transform 0.2s ease-out' : 'none'
}}>
```

### How it Works

1. **Mouse Down**: Reset `dragOffset` to 0, set cursor to `grabbing`

2. **Mouse Move**:
   - Calculate delta: `startY - currentY`
   - Update state: `setDragOffset(-delta)`
   - Transform applied instantly (no transition)
   - Drag up (delta > 0) → Image moves up
   - Drag down (delta < 0) → Image moves down

3. **Mouse Up**:
   - Check if delta > threshold (100px) → Navigate
   - Reset `dragOffset` to 0
   - Smooth transition back to original position (200ms ease-out)

### Visual Feedback Details

**Transform Behavior:**
- Drag amount matches mouse movement exactly (1:1 ratio)
- No transition while dragging (instant feedback)
- Smooth snap-back animation on release (if not navigating)

**Cursor States:**
- `grab` when hovering
- `grabbing` while dragging
- Returns to `grab` on release

## Files Modified

1. **paged-mode.tsx**
   - Added `dragOffset` state
   - Added `imageRef` for transform target
   - Updated `handleMouseMove` to set offset in real-time
   - Applied `translateY` transform to image container

2. **dual-page-mode.tsx**
   - Added `dragOffset` state
   - Added `pagesRef` for transform target
   - Updated `handleMouseMove` to set offset in real-time
   - Applied `translateY` transform to pages container

3. **vertical-mode.tsx**
   - No changes needed (already responsive via native scroll)

## User Experience

### Before
- Drag feels "sticky" or delayed
- No visual indication until threshold is met
- Uncertain if drag is being detected

### After
✅ Image follows your mouse instantly
✅ 1:1 drag-to-movement ratio (native feeling)
✅ Clear visual feedback during drag
✅ Smooth snap-back if drag < threshold
✅ Immediate page change if drag > threshold

## Technical Specifications

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Transform type | `translateY()` |
| Ratio | 1:1 (mouse px = image px) |
| Transition (dragging) | none |
| Transition (release) | 200ms ease-out |
| Threshold | 100px |
| Cursor states | grab → grabbing → grab |

## Build Status
✅ ESLint: Passing
✅ TypeScript: Passing
✅ Build: Success (reader 10.5 kB)

## Testing Notes
- Drag feels much more responsive and native
- Visual feedback is instant and smooth
- Snap-back animation is polished
- Works consistently across paged and dual-page modes
